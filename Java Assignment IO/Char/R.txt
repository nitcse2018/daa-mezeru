All the I/O streams covered so far are one-way streams. That is, they are either read-only input stream or write-only output stream. Furthermore, they are all sequential-access (or serial) streams, meant for reading and writing data sequentially. Nonetheless, it is sometimes necessary to read a file record directly as well as modifying existing records or inserting new records. The class RandomAccessFile provides supports for non-sequential, direct (or random) access to a disk file. RandomAccessFile is a two-way stream, supporting both input and output operations in the same stream.

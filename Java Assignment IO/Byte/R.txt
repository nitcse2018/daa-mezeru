Data streams (DataInputStream and DataOutputStream) allow you to read and write primitive data (such as int, double) and String, rather than individual bytes. Object streams (ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream) go one step further to allow you to read and write entire objects (such as Date, ArrayList or any custom objects).

Object serialization is the process of representing a "particular state of an object" in a serialized bit-stream, so that the bit stream can be written out to an external device (such as a disk file or network). The bit-stream can later be re-constructed to recover the state of that object. Object serialization is necessary to save a state of an object into a disk file for persistence or sent the object across the network for applications such as Web Services, Distributed-object applications, and Remote Method Invocation (RMI).
